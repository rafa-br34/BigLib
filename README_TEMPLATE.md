# BigLib
## About
BigLib is a project in its early alpha stages with ambitious goals of being a multi-platform and multi-architecture library with many algorithms, implementations, features, and compatibility.
BigLib will compile and run from Windows, Linux, and macOS to bare hardware-level x86/x64, ARM, and microcontrollers by using user-defined IO functions(such as functions for memory management) and feature macros. </br>
