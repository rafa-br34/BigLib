BigLib is a multi-purpose, feature-rich, and multi-architecture-focused C++ library in its early alpha stages. 

## Question and Answers

### How many architectures/platforms will BigLib support?
Currently, the goal is to get every algorithm working using the standard library the less as possible. Once the base library is done, the phase of making it easily usable for multiple architectures will start. The plans are for the library to support any architecture with an available C++ compiler.
